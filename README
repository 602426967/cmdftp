1.  LICENSE

    This program (called cmdftp) is copyright (C) 2003-2005 Claudio Fontana,
    and is free software under the GPL (GNU General Public License).
    You may read all the details about the license in the COPYING file
    included in this release.

2.  GETTING THE CODE TO RUN

    Use the sequence

    ./configure
    make
    make install

    A man page will be installed in section 1 of your manual.

2.5 CONFIGURATION TIPS - Skip if you are fine with defaults
    
    Use ./configure --help to get all possible options.
    
    Here's an example:
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --disable-largefile

    The cmdftp executable will be installed in /usr/local/bin, and large file
    support will be disabled (do not do it in real life).
    
    You can pass alternative compilation flags through CFLAGS.
    For example, to optimize cmdftp for size using gcc, do something like:

    ./configure CFLAGS='-Os'
    make
    make install

    If you want to further reduce size, and do not mind losing all symbols,

    ./configure CFLAGS='-Os'
    make
    make install-strip

    This produces a small executable (30K on my i386 linux system), without
    any loss in performance (since the bottleneck is the connection and time
    is never spent in tight code, -O2 and -O3 are just wasting executable
    space). I would suggest this for production, however you will not be able
    to report bugs without symbols.

    If you are using a size-optimized, stripped binary and experience runtime
    errors (a segmentation fault for example), please reinstall cmdftp without
    size-optimization and with full symbols before running gdb and backtracing
    (See below about bug reporting).
 
    Again, look at ./configure --help for all possible options available at
    the configuration phase.

3.  USAGE

    type 

    cmdftp -h

    to get all command line options.
    If your system supports long options, they are shown.

4.  COMMANDS

    At the cmdftp prompt, type

    h

    to display all available commands.
    See the man page for the details.
    
5.  ENVIRONMENT

    Environment variables recognized by cmdftp are:

    HOME, PAGER, EDITOR

    Also, cmdftp uses ~/.netrc for the autologin feature. See man netrc.
    To set environment variables refer to your shell documentation.

6.  "PROXY"

    cmdftp deals with FTP only and does not handle proxies in any special way.
    It has been tested working ok with ftp.proxy (http://www.ftpproxy.org).

    Here is what you do with ftp.proxy:

    Connect to the proxy, then specify login@host as username.

    You might need to disable autologin if the ftp proxy allows for a single
    login attempt.

    Your connection will be with the proxy for all means.
    For example, your ~/.netrc might not do what you expect it to do.
    This could change in the future (feedback welcome).

7.  COMMENTS/BUG REPORTS/HELP...

    The help forum is no more so please send bug reports to the
    sourceforge bug tracking at the project page:

    http://sourceforge.net/project/cmdftp/ [Click on Bugs]

    Or send feedback directly to the AUTHOR: sick_soul@users.sourceforge.net

    There is documentation available on how to report cmdftp bugs in the
    Docs section of the project page.
